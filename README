source from the book :OSGi and Apache Felix 3.0
As the felix has updated to 4.4.1, so some dependency issues will cause error.
I have fixed the issues in the all pom.xml files.

If you use jdk1.7, you should 
  1, java -XX:-UseSplitVerifier  -jar bin/felix.jar 
  2, java -XX:-UseSplitVerifier -Dhttp.proxyHost=xxx.sgp.xx.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttp.proxyUser= -Dhttp.proxyPassword= -jar bin/felix.jar

Else you'll get error like:
  Expecting a stackmap frame at branch target 12.Expected stackmap frame at this location. This is the jdk1.7 bug,so you should add -XX:-UseSplitVerifier
